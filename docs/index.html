                    My name is Cristopher Herrera, a Software Engineer based in Austin, Texas. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree from Pennsylvania State University in 2022

                    Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by technology. However, it wasn’t until I reached college that I finally got the chance to write my very first line of code. Since then, I have spent countless hours learning new technologies and developing my passion for coding.

                    During my senior year at Penn State, I won the Computer Science award for the Capstone Design project. I had very little knowledge about game development at the start of the semester, but with the help of my team, I quickly picked it up and excelled. This outstanding accomplishment not only increased my confidence but also demonstrated my ability to learn and develop my skills.

                    Later that summer, I had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of an innovative Web3 and blockchain educational website for a startup company. As the lead front-end developer, I was responsible for designing and developing wireframes, creating new user interfaces, and connecting to the back-end database. Throughout the project, I learned how to work efficiently under tight deadlines while maintaining a high level of quality in my work.

                    Currently, I am thriving as a Full Stack Java Developer at Cognixia, where I specialize in utilizing Spring Boot, together with SQL, and AWS to create robust and scalable software solutions. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and contributing to the advancement of innovative projects.
